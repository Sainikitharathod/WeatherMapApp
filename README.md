**WeatherMapApp**

WeatherMapApp is a React.js-based weather application that allows users to check the real-time weather of different cities around the world.
It fetches live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a clean, responsive interface.

## Features
1.Search for current weather by city name

2.Display temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather conditions, etc.

3.Dynamic weather cards for multiple locations

4.Responsive design for desktop and mobile

5.Clean modal for adding new cities

6.Modular and maintainable code structure


## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run the project locally:
# Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Sainikitharathod/WeatherMapApp.git

# Navigate into the project directory

cd WeatherMapApp/my-app

# Install dependencies

npm instal

# Start the development server

npm start

The app will run locally on: http://localhost:3000

## Usage

1.Open the app and enter the name of any city you want to check.

2.View details like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

3.Add multiple cities to see weather cards for all of them.

4.Remove a city when you no longer want to track it.

## Technologies Used

-OpenWeatherMap API – Source of live weather data


**Conclusion**
---------------
This project was built to explore and demonstrate the power of React.js for creating dynamic, real-time applications.
By integrating with the OpenWeatherMap API, it provides a practical, user-friendly interface to view weather information anytime, anywhere.

I learned a lot through this project — from component structuring and API integration to handling asynchronous requests and designing responsive UI.
It’s just the beginning, and I’m excited to keep improving it with new features, cleaner code, and better user experience.
